# RODEM HEP GitHub

This is the GitHub area for the RODEM Particle Physics group at the University of Geneva.

## What is RODEM?

[RODEM: Robust Deep Density Models for High-Energy Physics and Solar Physics](https://rodem.ch/)

A Sinergia research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF 2021-2024

## Who are RODEM HEP?

Prof. Tobias Golling and his research group at the DPNC, University of Geneva

Members of the ATLAS collaboration and ML in HEP community

## Areas of interest

Cover a broad spectrum of modern machine learning models, with focus on deep learning and in particular generative modelling.

Developing new ML approaches for application to particle physics problems, and using particle physics to feed back into development of modern ML techniques.
